## Requirements managment

This report has the goal to reflect over how the requirements for the project are born, how the team decides how to implement  new features, basically the process of requirement elicitation which in [requirements engineering](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/requirements-engineering) is an essential practice which consist in the collection of requirements from users, customers and personnel related with the project in any way in order to make them feasible functions of the software.
A requirement is a documented necessity that the software must perfom.

As stated in the previous report our conversation with one of the founding developers the project was born as a very simple script and soon the users began requesting features to be added to the project, it was at this point that the project began expanding.

### The Scope

When we initiated contact with the developers of Youtube-dl, specifically [Ricardo Gonzalez](https://github.com/rg3) one of the very first things he told us was that the initial idea for the project was a very simplistic one with a very simple goal, to be abble to download videos from Youtube in a very straightforward fashion, this meant there was no software process model and therefore no prototyping nor requirement elicitation. This means our project is a little off to what we study in our Software Engineering lessons however we will shape this very unorganized process into the concepts we are familiared with.
After more users began utilizing Youtube-dl the developers entered inadvertently the process of Requirements Engineering, to put it in a very basic way, we can look at the original idea of **Downloading a video** as the "vaguely defined problem, and then through the **[Issues List](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues)** on Github, users began requesting new websites to be added to the software capabilities that would be qualified as the actual "Requirement Engineering" then followed by the attempt at **implementation by the developers** themselves or the public through **pull requests** on github. 
The decision making process about the implementation of new features is now mostly controlled by a couple of developers that mantain a common vision for the project and are mostly foccused on implementing **functional requirements**. These functional requirements were born mostly of **brainstorming** sessions and requests from users. We are unsure of the actual step by step process of decision making for this, however we are lead to believe they follow a centralized idea and go through very basic processes of **elicitation, analisys and negotiation, specification and validation.**
