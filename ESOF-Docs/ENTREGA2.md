## Requirements managment

This report has the goal to reflect over how the requirements for the project are born, how the team decides how to implement  new features, basically the process of requirement elicitation which in [requirements engineering](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/requirements-engineering) is an essential practice which consist in the collection of requirements from users, customers and personnel related with the project in any way in order to make them feasible functions of the software.
A requirement is a documented necessity that the software must perfom.
As stated in the previous report our conversation with one of the founding developers the project was born as a very simple script and soon the users began requesting features to be added to the project, it was at this point that the project began expanding and the "Requirements elicitation" process began.

## Requirement Specification

Usually most projects have a software requirements specification (SRS), which is a description of a software system to be developed. It lays out functional and non-functional requirements, and may include a set of use cases that describe user interactions that the software must provide. Youtube-Dl doesn't use one. %%%UPDATING%%%
